# Refactor-Webpage-Challenge-1

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

Other than in hopes of earning a good grade, the purpose of this project was to debug, condense, and add to the HTML and CSS code we were given for the "Horiseon" website. To do this, I needed to recall what we learned during the first week of classes as well as utilize w3schools.com for additional coding resources/examples. 

## Installation

No installation needed. It can be accessed at https://bburleigh.github.io/Refactor-Webpage-HW1/.

## Usage

In theory, I am a member of a marketing agency who wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines. 

## Credits

Aside from my instructor and TA, I pulled bits of code and information from w3schools.com.

## License

None.
